# About Project:

This is my first react project made to test out the framework. I will use the concepts I learnt while making this project to make a "Twitter type website" which will linked here as soon as it is ready.

It was a fun project to make. I used [this](https://youtu.be/tEMrD9t85v4) tutorial to make the development process simple.

# Getting Data:

The idea of creating a JS file to stimulate JSON data coming from an API was quite interesting to me. I am planning to make a repo with dummy data in various settings that makes the process of generating and using dummy data in project simple.

The way the data fetching works is simple:
I have images of the products in the "assets" folder. The images are imported in "products.js" file and are renamed. Then JSON format is used to assign values and properties to each product and display it on web app.

# Getting Started with Create React App:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
